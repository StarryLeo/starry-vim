# [ALE]

ALE(Asynchronous Lint Engine) is a plugin for providing real-time linting(checking syntax and semantics through running external linters) in Vim 8 while you edit your text files,
and acts as a Vim [Language Server Protocol](https//langserver.org) client.
This allows for displaying warnings and errors in files being edited in Vim before files have been saved back to a filesystem.

ALE support a wide variety of languages and tools. See the [full list](https://github.com/w0rp/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md).

**Customizations**:

 * `<Space>j` : jump to next warnings and errors
 * `<Space>k` : jump to previous warnings and errors
