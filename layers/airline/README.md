# [Airline]

Airline provides a lightweight themable statusline with no external dependencies.
By default this configuration uses the [Powerline] symbols as separators for different statusline sections but can be configured to use the unicode symbols.

You can also install one of the [Powerline Fonts] or patch your favorite font using the [nerd-fonts].
If you do not like the [Powerline] symbols, you need to add `let g:starry_no_powerline_symbols = 1` to `~/.starry`.
